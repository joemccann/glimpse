# Glimpse

**A native macOS menu bar app for Claude Code tasks**

Monitor your Claude Code tasks in real-time with a sleek Kanban-style popover. No dock icon, no clutter - just glance at your menu bar.

## See It In Action

### All your projects, one glance

Switch between Claude Code projects instantly. See task counts and activity indicators at a glance — green dots show where work is happening right now.

### Smart session management

Glimpse automatically detects orphaned sessions — old, completed, or disconnected from their project. Yellow badges flag stale sessions so you can clean up with confidence.

### Full context when you need it

Click any task to see its complete description, current status, and dependencies. Add your own notes to track decisions or capture next steps without leaving the menu bar.

### Safe cleanup, no accidents

Delete sessions with confidence. Glimpse shows exactly what will be removed — task counts, completion status — and requires explicit confirmation before any permanent action.

## Requirements

## Installation

### Download

Download the latest `.dmg` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/joemccann/glimpse/releases):

1. Download `Glimpse-x.x.x.dmg`
2. Open the DMG and drag Glimpse to Applications
3. Launch from Applications or Spotlight

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joemccann/glimpse.git
cd glimpse
./scripts/build-app.sh --install
```

This builds a production `.app` bundle and installs it to `/Applications`.

### Build only

```bash
./scripts/build-app.sh
```

The app bundle will be at `build/Glimpse.app`.

## Usage

1. Launch Glimpse - an orange gem icon appears in your menu bar
2. **Left-click** the icon to open the Kanban popover
3. Use the **project picker** to filter by project (shows folder names)
4. Use the **session picker** to filter by session within that project
5. Click any task card to view details and add notes
6. **Right-click** for the context menu (Preferences, Quit)

### Deleting Orphaned Sessions

Sessions are automatically marked as "orphaned" when they:
- Are older than configurable threshold (default: 30 days)
- Have no matching project in `~/.claude/projects/`
- Have all tasks completed
- Have no tasks (empty sessions)

**To delete individual sessions:**
1. Click the session dropdown to expand the session list
2. Hover over a session to reveal the delete (trash) icon
3. Click the trash icon and confirm deletion

**To bulk cleanup all orphans:**
1. Click the 🗑️ trash icon with count in the footer (next to settings)
2. Confirm deletion of all orphan sessions

Orphaned sessions show a yellow "orphan" badge for easy identification.

### Preferences

Access via the ⚙️ gear icon in the footer or right-click menu:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Claude Directory | Path to your `.claude` folder (default: `~/.claude`) |
| Notifications | Toggle alerts for task/session completion |
| **Session Cleanup** | |
| Auto-remove completed | Automatically delete completed sessions on launch |
| Stale session age | Days before a session is considered stale (7-90, default: 30) |
| Cleanup Orphans | Button to delete all orphan sessions at once |
| Theme | System, Light, or Dark mode |

## Development

```bash
cd Glimpse
swift run
```

## How it works

Claude Code stores tasks in `~/.claude/tasks/`. Glimpse watches this directory using FSEvents and updates the UI in real-time - no polling required.

## Acknowledgments

Glimpse was inspired by [claude-task-viewer](https://github.com/L1AD/claude-task-viewer), an Electron-based Claude Code task viewer. This project reimagines the concept as a lightweight native macOS menu bar app.
